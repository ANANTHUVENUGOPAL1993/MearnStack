        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Author: V B Bhandari</h3>
        <h4  style="text-align: center;">Pages-944</h4>
        <p>This book provides a systematic exposition of the basic concepts and techniques involved in machine design. Throughout the book SI units have been followed and the BIS designation of materials and components used. Design principles have been explained in detail and exhaustively illustrated through solved examples.
